# Tolk_test

## Description of the developed software

The poject is desgined to allow users (customers) to train more (fine-tune) pre-trained classification models (classification of chatbot intentions) with personalized dataset by interacting with an API built to let the users select the pre-trained model (chatbot) based on domain, upload thier new dataset and interact with the newly fine-tuned chatbot. The flowchart below illustrates an overview of the project process.

## Set up
Clone or download the project files to local device and unzip it

### The user has ananconda python in his/her device
1) Open termainal (Mac, Linux) or anaconda prompt as administrator (windows)

2) Move to the directory containing the unziped project files using 'cd' command

3) Create an new virtual environment with the following command:

   >conda create -n chatbot_api python=3.8.5

4) Activate the environment with the following command:

   >conda activate chatbot_api

5) Install the needed python packages with the following command:

   >pip install -r requirements.txt

Now the user is set to run the codes of the projects

### The user doesn't have anaconda python in his/her device
1) Install miniconda for Python 3.8 using the instruction (system-based) in the link below:

   https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

2) Open termainal (Mac, Linux) or anaconda prompt (Miniconda3) as administrator (windows)

3) Move to the directory containing the unziped project files using 'cd' command

4) Create an new virtual environment with the following command:

   >conda create -n chatbot_api python=3.8.5

5) Activate the environment with the following command:

   >conda activate chatbot_api

6) Install the needed python packages with the following command:

   >pip install -r requirements.txt

Now the user is set to run the codes of the projects
